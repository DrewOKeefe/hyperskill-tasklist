# hyperskill-tasklist

This kotlin program creates and manages a tasklist by creating/writing/reading a json file.
Users can create and add new tasks, as well as edit and delete existing tasks.
The program stores data in the JSON file so that after the program ends, the same data can be called back after restarting the program.
